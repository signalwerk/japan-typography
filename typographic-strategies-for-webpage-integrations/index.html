            <p>
              <span
                >In Japanese graphic design, particularly on posters, flyers,
                and other printed materials, there&#x27;s a unique approach to
                directing viewers to websites. Instead of providing a direct URL
                (Uniform Resource Locator), designers opt for a small
                illustration resembling a search field accompanied by specific
                keywords. This method is a practical solution for directing
                audiences to web content.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >The illustration usually depicts a simplified search bar,
                sometimes with a magnifying glass icon, similar to those found
                in web browsers or search engines. Next to or within this
                graphic, designers place keywords that are unique or highly
                relevant to the content being referenced. This method relies on
                the assumption that users will enter these keywords into a
                search engine to find the specific website.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >The visual simplicity and elegance of this method reflects the
                common behaviour exhibited by users when transitioning to
                digital media â€“ accessing content is typically done by using a
                search engine. By providing relevant keywords, the sender
                increases the likelihood that the user will find the desired
                page.</span

            <h3><span>Observation in the Western Typography</span></h3>
            <p>
              <span
                >In contrast, Western graphic design typically uses direct URLs
                or QR codes to guide viewers to websites. URLs provide a
                straightforward, exact path to a specific webpage. QR codes,
                while innovative for technical use cases, face accessibility
                challenges for readers. They depend on specific technology, like
                smartphones with cameras and Apps understanding QR-codes. This
                creates barriers for groups like older adults or those without
                smartphones. Unlike search terms that convey information and can
                be remembered, QR codes are cryptic and give no hints about
                their content. Their use also demands immediate, direct
                interaction with the printed material, which can be inconvenient
                in public spaces. Unlike URLs or search terms that can be noted
                or remembered for later use, QR codes must be used at the
                moment, limiting their flexibility and longevity. While
                functional, QR codes are often seen as intrusive elements in a
                design layout, challenging designers to incorporate them without
                disrupting the visual harmony of the piece.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >The Japanese method of indicating web content through search
                terms within a graphic representation of a search field offers
                intriguing possibilities for Western typography and graphic
                design. It prompts a reevaluation of how we guide viewers to
                online content and the potential for more integrated,
                aesthetically pleasing solutions. This approach also underscores
                the importance of understanding user behaviours and preferences
                in the digital age.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >For Western designers, adopting a similar strategy could mean
                creating a more seamless bridge between print and digital media.
                It encourages a thoughtful consideration of keywords, their
                typographic presentation, and how they can be visually
                harmonized within a design. This method also invites designers
                to explore more iconographic elements in typography, blending
                text and imagery in innovative ways.</span
