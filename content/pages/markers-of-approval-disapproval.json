In the Western world, the cross (âœ•) and checkmark (âœ“) are commonly used to denote incorrect and correct items, respectively.\nThe cross (âœ•), has evolved to become a universal sign of error or disagreement in the context of the Latin alphabet. Similarly, the checkmark (âœ“), originating as a mark of confirmation or correctness, is well understood in the western world. In Japan, different symbols are used for similar purposes."

It is used to indicate that something is correct or acceptable, akin to the checkmark in the Western context. A double line (âœ•), known as Â«batsuÂ» in Japanese, is used for marking something wrong or incorrect. It is similar in use to the Western cross.\n\nOther Symbols: Japanese typography may also use other symbols for specific contexts, like in grading or feedback forms. The symbol of a bullseye (â—Ž) is called Â«nijÅ«maruÂ» and often used to denote excellence or superiority, A triangle (â–³) can carry the meaning Â«so-soÂ» and is named Â«sankakuÂ»\n\n\nFor instance, a triangle might be used to denote something that needs attention or improvement.\n\n"
