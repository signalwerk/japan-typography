Their use varies based on context and the specific types of brackets employed. Brackets in the Latin alphabet are used to organize text, clarify meaning, and ensure readability, while also fulfilling specific linguistic functions in various professional and academic contexts. Their typographical roles complement these linguistic functions by providing visual cues to guide the reader's understanding and interpretation of the text. \n\nSome common uses of brackets in Latin alphabets follow.

This aspect of typographic design showcases the variety and distinct roles these elements play, contributing to the overall structure and style of the script.\n\nJapanese script features various brackets[^wiki-japanese-punctuation], such as corner brackets「」/『』, lenticular brackets【】, and tortoise shell brackets〔〕. Each type of bracket serves a specific purpose and is chosen based on the context and content of the text. \nThe functional aspects of these brackets are diverse. For instance, corner brackets are commonly used for direct speech[^jpn-with-anime] or titles, while lenticular brackets often enclose definitions or explanations. This functional specificity enhances the meaning and clarity of the written text.\n\n[^jpn-with-anime]: [Japanese with Anime · Quotation Marks](https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2017/05/quotation-marks-japanese.html)\n[^wiki-japanese-punctuation]: [Wikipedia · Japanese punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_punctuation)\n[^wiki-japanese-typographic-symbols]: [Wikipedia · Japanese typographic symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Japanese_typographic_symbols)"

The distinct shapes and aesthetics that the Japanese forms offer can provide fresh perspectives. By incorporating these elements into Latin typography, we can enhance the visual appeal of our texts, particularly in formats where our options for text formatting are limited, such as social media. Having a wider range of expression in such contexts is greatly appreciated."
