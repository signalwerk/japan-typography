      "body": "## Introduction\nThis thesis explores unspoken and purely visual elements in Japanese typography[^chat-gpt-title] from the perspective of a typographer familiar with languages written in the Latin alphabet. It delves into the subtle, typographic features of Japanese script that are relevant in written form and highlights their significance in the broader context of typographic design and communication. The goal is to observe these elements and showcase how they contribute to the overall aesthetics of written Japanese.\n\nThis approach is not about cultural borrowing, but rather about the exploration of typographic diversity[^youtube-japanese-modern-typography] and its potential to enrich Latin typography. This exploration is aimed at understanding how diverse typographic elements can coexist and enhance each other. It reflects a broader perspective on the potential for typographic elements to evolve and adapt in a globally connected environment.\n\n[^youtube-japanese-modern-typography]: [Tanaka Ikko and the Japanese Modern Typography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q4gycuJhks)\n\nThis thesis was written as part of the CAS Design Cultures 2023 program at [Zurich University of the Arts](https://www.zhdk.ch/) and based on a field trip to Japan (28. 10. 2023 – 13. 11. 2023) where most observations were documented. Generative AI was used in co-authorship and is clearly marked with footnotes where the AI had a creative process. Other parts of this work might also be supported with AI, but only as a tool to formulate, translate or expand the author's original thoughts.\n\n\n\n[^chat-gpt-title]: [ChatGPT · Finding a title for this thesis](https://chat.openai.com/share/11bed6ad-e575-4b5c-a4ed-7855d96ab6b7)"

It serves to highlight additional information, similar to the usage of footnotes in Western texts. It is typically found in academic texts, annotated works, or in instances where additional information is necessary but not always integral to the primary text. Its distinct appearance, resembling a flower or asterisk. Its name literally translates to «rice symbol», as the symbol resembles to the kanji for «rice» (米)[^wiki-reference-mark]. The visual appearance is unique, and it adds both functionality and contextual value to the text.  \n\n\n[^wiki-reference-mark]: [Wikipedia · Reference mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_mark)"

These symbols are used in a similar manner, directing readers to footnotes or endnotes for additional information. However, the ※ mark differs in its design and cultural context.   \nBut even in cultures that use the Latin alphabet, not all markings are used uniformly. For instance, in English academic writing, the dagger (†) is often used as a secondary footnote marker after the asterisk (\\*)[^wiki-reference-dagger]. In German texts, the usage is similar, but there is a greater tendency to indicate deceased individuals, particularly in bibliographies, and this practice is more consistent. Nevertheless, both languages employ the dagger sparingly to maintain text clarity.\n\n\n\n[^wiki-reference-dagger]: [Wikipedia · Dagger (mark)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_(mark))"

      "body": "## Brackets\n\n### Latin Alphabet\nBrackets found in the Latin alphabet, serve not only linguistic but also typographic purposes. Their use varies based on context and the specific types of brackets employed. Brackets in the Latin alphabet are used to organize text, clarify meaning, and ensure readability, while also fulfilling specific linguistic functions in various professional and academic contexts. Their typographical roles complement these linguistic functions by providing visual cues to guide the reader's understanding and interpretation of the text. \n\nSome common uses of brackets in Latin alphabets follow.

This aspect of typographic design showcases the variety and distinct roles these elements play, contributing to the overall structure and style of the script.\n\nJapanese script features various brackets[^wiki-japanese-punctuation], such as corner brackets「」/『』, lenticular brackets【】, and tortoise shell brackets〔〕. Each type of bracket serves a specific purpose and is chosen based on the context and content of the text. \nThe functional aspects of these brackets are diverse.

Instead of providing a direct URL (Uniform Resource Locator), designers opt for a small illustration resembling a search field accompanied by specific keywords. This method is a practical solution for directing audiences to web content.\n\nThe illustration usually depicts a simplified search bar, sometimes with a magnifying glass icon, similar to those found in web browsers or search engines. Next to or within this graphic, designers place keywords that are unique or highly relevant to the content being referenced. This method relies on the assumption that users will enter these keywords into a search engine to find the specific website. \n\nThe visual simplicity and elegance of this method reflects the common behaviour exhibited by users when transitioning to digital media – accessing content is typically done by using a search engine.

Their use also demands immediate, direct interaction with the printed material, which can be inconvenient in public spaces. Unlike URLs or search terms that can be noted or remembered for later use, QR codes must be used at the moment, limiting their flexibility and longevity.
