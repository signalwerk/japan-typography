Their use varies based on context and the specific types of brackets employed. Brackets in the Latin alphabet are used to organize text, clarify meaning, and ensure readability, while also fulfilling specific linguistic functions in various professional and academic contexts. Their typographical roles complement these linguistic functions by providing visual cues to guide the reader's understanding and interpretation of the text. \n\nSome common uses of brackets in Latin alphabets follow.

This aspect of typographic design showcases the variety and distinct roles these elements play, contributing to the overall structure and style of the script.\n\nDiversity of Bracket Styles: Japanese script features various brackets, such as corner brackets「」/『』, lenticular brackets【】, and tortoise shell brackets〔〕. Each style serves a specific purpose and is selected based on the context and content of the text. \nThe functional aspects of these brackets are diverse. For instance, corner brackets are commonly used for direct speech[^jpn-with-anime] or titles, while lenticular brackets often enclose definitions or explanations. This functional specificity adds a layer of meaning and clarity to the written text.\n\n[^jpn-with-anime]: [Japanese with Anime · Quotation Marks](https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2017/05/quotation-marks-japanese.html)\n[^wiki-japanese-punctuation]: [Wikipedia · Japanese punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_punctuation)\n"
