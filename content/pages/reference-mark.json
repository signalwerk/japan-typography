Its name literally translates to «rice symbol», as the symbol resembles to the kanji for «rice» (米)[^wiki-reference-mark].\nIt serves to highlight additional information, similar to the usage of footnotes in Western texts. It is typically found in academic texts, annotated works, or in instances where additional information is necessary but not always integral to the primary text. Its distinct appearance, resembling a flower or asterisk. Its visual appearance is unique, and it adds both functionality and contextual value to the text.  \n\n\n[^wiki-reference-mark]: [Wikipedia · Reference mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_mark)"

These symbols are used in a similar manner, directing readers to footnotes or endnotes for additional information. However, the ※ mark differs in its design and cultural context.   \nBut even in cultures that use the Latin alphabet, not all markings are used uniformly. For instance, in English academic writing, the dagger (†) is often used as a secondary footnote marker after the asterisk (\\*)[^wiki-reference-dagger]. In German texts, the usage is similar, but there is a greater tendency to indicate deceased individuals, particularly in bibliographies, and this practice is more consistent. Nevertheless, both languages employ the dagger sparingly to maintain text clarity.\n\n\n\n[^wiki-reference-dagger]: [Wikipedia · Dagger (mark)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_(mark))"
